# PCA-Breast-Cancer-Analysis

I worked with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset to understand patterns in high-dimensional medical data and simplify it without losing important information.

## 🔍 What I built
  Preprocessed the dataset using StandardScaler
  Applied PCA (2D & 3D) to reduce 30 features
  Created multiple visualizations to explore data patterns
  Plotted a Scree Plot to analyze explained variance

## Trained ML models:
  Logistic Regression | SVM | Random Forest
  Compared the accuracy before vs. after PCA

📊 Key Insights

🔹 PCA clearly separated benign vs malignant samples

 🔹 Even after reducing dimensions, model accuracy stayed strong
 
 🔹 PCA helps simplify data while keeping essential patterns intact


## 🚀 Why this project matters

Through this project, I learned:

 ✔️ How PCA is used in medical datasets
 
 ✔️ How to visualize high-dimensional features
 
 ✔️ How dimensionality reduction affects ML models
 
 ✔️ How to build an end-to-end ML mini-project
