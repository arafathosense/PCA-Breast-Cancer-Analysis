# PCA-Breast-Cancer-Analysis

I worked with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset to understand patterns in high-dimensional medical data and simplify it without losing important information.

🔍 What I built
Preprocessed the dataset using StandardScaler
Applied PCA (2D & 3D) to reduce 30 features
Created multiple visualizations to explore data patterns
Plotted a Scree Plot to analyze explained variance

Trained ML models:
 Logistic Regression | SVM | Random Forest
Compared the accuracy before vs. after PCA

📊 Key Insights
🔹 PCA clearly separated benign vs malignant samples
 🔹 Even after reducing dimensions, model accuracy stayed strong
 🔹 PCA helps simplify data while keeping essential patterns intact
